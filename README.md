# BoundedDeletionSpaceSaving

This code implement the BoundedDeletionSpaceSaving described in the paper SpaceSavingÂ±: An Optimal Algorithm for Frequency Estimation and Frequent items in the Bounded Deletion Model

All sketches in this repo are not optimized in any way, and they are prototypes to demonstrate the theoritical results.

Use the jupyter notebook to run the experiments. 
The Evaluation.ipynb file contains full instructions for reproducing our results.

Download the TCP trace files from https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/passive_dataset/ and store in data folder. You may need to modify the path in the jupyter notebook when reading the dataset.
